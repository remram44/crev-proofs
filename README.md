# Proof Repository

This git repository is a [Crev Proof Repository](https://github.com/dpc/crev/wiki/Proof-Repository).

<!-- Feel free to customize this file below this line -->

It contains my crev proofs, e.g. cryptographically-signed reviews of third-party Rust crates. You can use it to trust the crates that I have reviewed.
